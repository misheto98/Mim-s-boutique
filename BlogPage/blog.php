                <p class="blog-post-meta" style="text-decoration: underline;color:pink;">July 14, 2023 by Mihaela</p>

                <p class="text-center">During the day, many impurities accumulate on the surface of the skin, which are not visible to the naked eye. Make-up, powder and dust particles settle on the surface of the skin and clog the pores. The skin glands secrete oils - normally they moisturize the skin and regulate the pH value.

                    <br> If the lipid balance of the skin is disturbed or if the skin is not properly cared for every day, a number of problems can arise:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> » clogged pores</li>

                    <li> » inflammation and acne </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-center" style="color: #B597FF;font-family: 'Great Vibes', cursive; font-size:20px;">WHY SHOULD THE SKIN BE CLEANSED AND TONED ?</h2>


                <p class="text-center">The most important steps in skin care are cleansing and toning. They should be done twice a day. Daily skin care at home depends on the condition of the skin.</p>
                <p class="text-center">Cleaning is an important step in maintenance. Using make-up and cosmetics without prior cleansing is not effective - the skin and pores become dirty, which provokes the appearance of pimples and small imperfections. Even if you don't use makeup, you need to clean your skin.

                    Daily skin care at home cannot do without cleansing. At night, the skin intensively produces sebum. The morning therapy helps to remove excess sebum and prepare the skin for the day cream. </p>
                <h3 class="text-center" style="color:#FF5E41 ;font-family: 'Great Vibes', cursive; font-size:20px;">YOUR DAILY SKIN CARE SHOULD INCLUDE TONIG.TONERS SERVE SEVERAL PURPOSES:</h3>
                <p class="text-center"> Daily skin care for the face and neck is based on using a toner in the morning and evening. The toner restores the pH</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> » they help to neutralize the effects of detergents</li>

                    <li> » stabilizes the pH of the skin after cleansing </li>

                    <li> » prepare the skin for applying the cream</li>

                    <li> » improve the penetration of nutrients into the deep layers of the skin.</li>

                </ul>
                <p class="text-center" style="color:#E80992 ;font-family: 'Great Vibes', cursive; font-size:20px;">How do you want the right skin care products for yourself ?</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Daily skin care at home is individual. You should not ignore the advice of your beautician and choose your own skin care products.</li>
                    <li>The beautician should choose the products for daily skin care according to your type and condition, age and the presence of blemishes.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="text-center" style="color:#DF81B9 ;font-family: 'Great Vibes', cursive; font-size:20px;">How should I take care of my skin depending on my skin type?</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt class="text-center" style="color:#EF0997;">Oily and combination skin suffer from excessive sebum production. The skin is characterized by a characteristic oily sheen, which is particularly noticeable on the nose, forehead and chin.</dt>
                    <dd class="text-center">Daily care for problem skin is based on the use of products with a mousse texture that can be washed off with water. Such products do not disturb the balance of the skin. Abrasive products should not be used to care for problem skin, as they aggressively clean the skin and traumatize the epidermis.</dd>
                    <dt class="text-center" style="color:#EF0997;">Combination skin is characterized by a combination of two skin types. The so-called T-zone is characterized by an oily sheen, often with inflammatory lesions. There are dry patches in the cheek area. Combination skin is often uncompromisingly </dt>
                    <dd class="text-center">Daily skin care involves the use of gentle toners and non-greasy creams. Mattifying wipes can remove excess oil in the T-zone, and toners can normalize the skin's pH balance.</dd>
                    <dt class="text-center" style="color:#EF0997;">Dry skin suffers from a lack of sebum and moisture. The skin looks thin, taut and rough. Dry skin is prone to premature wrinkling. Products with a rich, oily texture can restore the comfort and beauty of your skin.</dt>
                    <dd class="text-center">Daily care for dry skin should include gentle milk, gentle tonic and nourishing creams with plant extracts. These products give your skin a healthy glow and beauty. Products that contain irritating alcohols and abrasive particles should be avoided in the daily care of dry skin.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h2 class="text-center" style="color:#FF5E41 ; font-family: 'Great Vibes', cursive; font-size:20px;">WHAT DOES DAILY SKIN CARE LOOK LIKE ?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cleaning . Cleansing products should be selected individually depending on the skin type. Products with a neutral pH and without surfactants (alkaline) are preferred.</li>
                    <li> Scrub. Skin toners dissolve dead cells on the surface of the skin through a gentle chemical action, renewing the skin and leaving it glowing and fresh.
                    </li>
                    <li> Humidifiers. The products work in two ways. And modern creams usually combine both. The first method is water retention. Glycerin and hyaluronic acid in creams retain water molecules.</li>

                    <li>Protection. Daily skin care includes the use of products with UV protection. It should be applied to exposed skin before going outdoors.</li>

                </ol>
